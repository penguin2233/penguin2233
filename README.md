### Uncertified programmer 

I am penguin2233, now owner of no website. I am a hobby C++ programmer with my main interest in the Windows API. 

I hope you can learn something from my contributions on GitHub.

The most fun project I have worked on is onscripter-xb, a port of onscripter to the original Xbox. It is not released to the public but will be soon. I took care of the intricacies of the XDK and fixed many roadblocks in allowing the engine to use SDL to run.
My interest in the WinAPI also led me to the creation of a few MFC programs, some of which are on my GitHub. I enjoy seeing my programs running on Windows 2000 as well as Windows 10.
I have also worked on projects that are cross platform across desktop OSes.
