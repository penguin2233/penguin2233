### Uncertified programmer 

I am penguin2233, my website is at http://penguin2233.x10host.com
I am a university student studying EE, taking a few CS subjects along the way.
Outside of university, I am a hobby C++ programmer with my main interest in the Windows API. 

I hope you can learn something from my contributions on GitHub.

My interest in the WinAPI also led me to the creation of a few MFC programs, some of which are on my GitHub. I enjoy seeing my programs running on Windows 2000 as well as Windows 10.

I have also worked on projects that are cross platform across desktop OSes.
