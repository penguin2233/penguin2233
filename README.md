### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am penguin2233, owner of penguin2233.gq website. I help osu-wiki project for fun and I am a hobby C++ programmer. 
Most of the code here is not of high quality, but it has gone through enough testing by me for me to trust.
I hope you can learn something or benefit from my contributions on GitHub.
